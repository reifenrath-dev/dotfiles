# Dotfiles
This is a collection of several config files for my developer environment.

## General
- [Bash Aliases](.bash_aliases)
- [Powershell Profile](rr.ps1)
- [Git Config](.gitconfig)

## Jetbrains IDE Settings
I included the [RiderUiSettings.zip](RiderUiSettings.zip) for a direct import and the unzipped folder [/RiderUiSettings](RiderUiSettings) to look at the files directly. I mainly use Rider but also other Jetbrains IDEs. These settings work for all their IDEs.

## Starship
My [Starship.rs](https://starship.rs/) config I am currently using: [Starship Pills](starship-pills.toml). I am using the Jetbrains Mono Nerdfont with my terminal from [ryanoasis/nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
